# AOC 2024

---

My solutions for [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This year I'll be doing it in rust again.

---

### How to run:

Use ``cargo run`` to run the newest solution,
or use ``cargo run -- --day=1 --part=1`` or ``cargo run -- -d1 -p1`` to run a specific day and part,
Use ``cargo run -- --all`` to run all days and see how fast they all get solved.

The cli will also tell you how long it took to run the code, and if it was on debug or release mode

You can also use ``cargo test`` to run the test with the provided test cases.
When I'm developing I like to use ``cargo watch -x test`` to automatically run the tests while programming,
this does require the [cargo watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) crate.

### My thoughts on each day

A bit of text describing my experience with creating a solution for a specific day.

* day 0: there is nothing here yet...
