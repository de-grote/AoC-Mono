# aoc monorepo
A collection of all the [aoc](https://adventofcode.com/) I did.

Sorted first by year, then language I did them in.

Don't expect full 50 stars on everything, I only have that on 2015 but I lost the code for that lol.

This might just become a trial ground for me trying programming languages idk.

Instructions on how to run differ wildly but can be found in the relevant readme.

More serious readme soon maybe.
